A web-based recording studio for [Opencast](https://opencast.org).

Opencast Studio uses the recording capabilities built into modern browsers to
record audio and video streams. The recording happens completely in the user's
browser: no server is involved in that part. Network access is only needed to
initially load the application and to (optionally) upload the videos to an
Opencast instance.


## Supported Browsers

<sup>1</sup> Non-Safari browser on iOS use the Safari browser engine, so behave essentially the same as Safari.

<sup>2</sup> Screen share on mobile devices not supported; only webcam recording.

<sup>3</sup> Display audio capture only possible through the use of "monitor sources" as microphone.

<sup>4</sup> Display audio capture only possible if sharing a tab, not the entire screen or individual application windows.

<sup>5</sup> Display audio capture not supported.



## Usage

There are mainly three ways how to use Opencast Studio.

### Integrated in Opencast

Starting with Opencast 8.2, Opencast Studio is integrated into and shipped with
Opencast itself. If you have an Opencast system already, this is the
easiest solution for you. See [the Opencast documentation about the module
'studio'](https://docs.opencast.org/develop/admin/#modules/studio/) for more
information.

### Standalone Version at [studio.opencast.org](https://studio.opencast.org)

Opencast Studio is always deployed from `master` branch.

You are free to use the publicly deployed version. However, there are two
caveats.

For one, `studio.opencast.org` is updated fairly regularly with the newest
version and is not tested as thoroughly as the Studio version integrated into
Opencast releases. That means that it might occasionally not work or introduce
backwards incompatible changes (mostly related to settings) at any time.

Additionally, in order to upload to your Opencast server from
`studio.opencast.org`, that server needs to be configured appropriately. In
particular, CORS requests from Studio need to be allowed and return the status
code 200. For nginx, you need to add this to your configuration:

```
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://studio.opencast.org always;
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods 'GET, POST, OPTIONS' always;
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true always;
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers 'Origin,Content-Type,Accept,Authorization' always;

# Always respond with 200 to OPTIONS requests as browsers do not accept
# non-200 responses to CORS preflight requests.
if ($request_method = OPTIONS) {
    # On newer nginx versions, you can optionally send an
    # Access-Control-Max-Age header to reduce the number of requests a browser
    # will send.
    #add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' 1728000;
    return 200;
}
```

### Self-hosted standalone version

As Studio is a client-only application, you can simply build it and then serve
the resulting static files.


## Configuration

See [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md).

## Opencast APIs used by Studio

Opencast Studio uses the following APIs:

- `/ingest/*`
- `/info/me.json`

You have to make sure that these APIs are accessible to the user using Studio.
In Opencast ≥8.2, providing a user with `ROLE_STUDIO` should grant a user all necessary rights.
In older versions, you might need to create such a role in the security configuration (e.g. `mh_default_org.xml`) of Opencast.


## Build Instructions

To clone Studio, execute these commands:

```sh
% git clone git@github.com:elan-ev/opencast-studio.git
% cd opencast-studio
% npm install
```

### Serve From Build Folder

You can serve the application from the `build/` folder.

```sh
% npm run build:release   # or npm run build:dev for development
```

This will generate static content you can serve via any web server in `build/`.

### Serve From Local Development Server

If you prefer to run a local development server directly, you can use this instead:

#### Unix-like OS

Unix-like (Linux and macOS) operating systems can use

```sh
% npm run start
```

#### Windows OS 

Windows-family operating systems can use 
 - Git Bash,
 - PowerShell, 
 - Windows Command Prompt(CMD) or,
 - Windows Subsystem for Linux 2(WSL2)

```sh
% npm run winstart
```


> [!CAUTION]
> ### PowerShell Execution Policy
> 
> PowerShell’s execution policy may prevent npm scripts from running. 
> 
> You can temporarily or permanently allow running scripts by modifying PowerShell's execution policy. 
> 
> **Option 1: Use Git Bash, CMD or WSL2**
> - **Git Bash and Windows Command Prompt** don’t enforce execution policies like PowerShell.
> - **Windows Subsystem for Linux 2** allows the use of a GNU/Linux environment from within Windows.
> - **PowerShell** has security restrictions that prevent running scripts unless explicitly allowed.
> 
> **Option 2: Temporary PowerShell Fix (For Current Session Only)**
> Run this in PowerShell before running your `npm` command:
> 
> ```sh
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
> ```
>
> - This only affects the current PowerShell session.
> - After closing PowerShell, the original policy is restored.
>
> **Option 3: Permanent PowerShell Fix (For Your User Account)**
> If you want to allow scripts permanently (for your user account only), run:
> 
> ```sh
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
> ```
>
> - This allows scripts to run if they are locally created or digitally signed.
> - Safer than Unrestricted, which allows all scripts.
>
> **Option 4: Completely Disable PowerShell Execution Policy (Not Recommended)**
> If you want to remove all script restrictions (**⚠ security risk**), run:
> 
> ```sh
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
> ```
>
> **⚠ Warning**: This allows running any script, including potentially harmful ones.
>


### Additional Build Options

By default, Studio expects to be deployed under the root path of a domain (e.g. https://studio.example.com/) and using a
sub-path would not work (e.g. https://example.com/studio). This can be changed by using a number of build options. You
can apply these options by exporting them as environment variable before starting the build process like this:

```sh
export OPTION=VALUE
npm run build:release
```

| Option                  | Example            | Description
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | -----------
| `PUBLIC_PATH`           | `/studio`          | Path from which Studio will be served
| `SETTINGS_PATH`         | `/mysettings.toml` | Path from which to load the configuration (see `CONFIGURATION.md` for more information)
| `INCLUDE_LEGAL_NOTICES` | `1`                | Set to `1` to include legal notices and information about elan e.V., any other value or having this variable not set will not include them. Unless you are working for elan e.V. there is probably no reason for you to use this variable.
